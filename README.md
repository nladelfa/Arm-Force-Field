Abstract: This paper describes the development of a novel method (termed the ‘Arm Force Field’ or ‘AFF’) to predict manual arm strength (MAS) for a wide range of body orientations, hand locations and any force direction. This method used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the effects of hand location and force direction on MAS, and included a method to estimate the contribution of the arm's weight to the predicted strength. The AFF method predicted the MAS values very well (r2 = 0.97, RMSD = 5.2 N, n = 456) and maintained good generalizability with external test data (r2 = 0.842, RMSD = 13.1 N, n = 80). The AFF can be readily integrated within any DHM ergonomics software, and appears to be a more robust, reliable and valid method of estimating the strength capabilities of the arm, when compared to current approaches.
